In a world split by the countries of East in West, you, the nameless hero of the game, have to travel from town to town and from dungeon to dungeon, fighting hordes of monsters and discovering treasure, in order to face in the final battle the greatest sorcerer of the world, who was responsible for the death of your father.

"Deep Dungeon IV" is a RPG similar to  Bard's Tale series. You navigate your character though the 3D world viewed from first person perspective, and fight monsters in turn-based combat.
