The Nekketsu gang crashes another sport with their wacky and violent gameplay style in Ike Ike! Nekketsu Hockey. As you might have imagined the sport in question this time is Ice Hockey and if you thought the sport was violent before wait until you play it with the ability to jump and perform spinning kicks!

Gameplay is similar to the Nekketsu Football games, with you controlling a lead character across the side-scrolling stadium and having minimal control of the AI players as they skate around the puck. Special shots can be made using specific button combinations, and as usual the game features a 1P-tournament mode and a Vs mode for up to 4 players simultaneous action.
