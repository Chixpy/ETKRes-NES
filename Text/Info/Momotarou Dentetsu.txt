Momotaro Dentetsu (that's right, not densetsu, "legend", but dentetsu, "train"!) is the first of the long series of board games that are loosely based on the popular Japanese folk tale of Momotarou, a boy who was found in a huge peach by an old couple, and who later became the savior of his village, defeating the evil demons and taking their treasure. The game can be played against computer AI or  human opponents (up to three). It is a board game in which the players' trains are positioned on the map of Japan, divided into sections with circles that determine the amount of moves. The latter is decided by a roll of a dice. There are special circles which take you to various locations in typically Japanese style, where you can gain some bonuses before you proceed with the "train competition".
