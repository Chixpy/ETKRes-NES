In Ai Sensei no Oshiete: Watashi no Hoshi, you need the help of Ai Sensei ("Love Teacher") in order to learn about your destiny. Basically, the game is a fortune teller/horoscope simulation. There is no challenge in the game: the only thing you have to do is to provide information about yourself (like when you were born, in which place you grew up, etc.). Then you enter the current date. After this, you can access a large menu, where you can learn various things about yourself by talking to Ai Sensei. Those things include general horoscope, your destiny depending on the planets, your future love life, etc. The explanations can be quite detailed and are often accompanied by pictures, which vary depending on the character you have created.
