In this game, you become a candidate for becoming a new United States president. You choose a candidate out of several available ones (both Republican and Democrats), and then raise your popularity in various states, competing with other candidates. You must excel in every area of politics, from foreign diplomacy to passing laws in a state. After each stage, you are shown statistics where your success is compared to that of other presidents. You can also check at any stage the reaction of the people to your deeds, making surveys and seeing how well you are doing.
