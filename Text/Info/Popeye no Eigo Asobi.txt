This game aims to help younger Japanese speaking children learn some English vocabulary words. The game features Popeye the Sailorman, Bluto, Olive Oyl, and Swee'Pea, plus two locations from the game Popeye. The game modes included are Word Puzzle A,  Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.

In Word Puzzle A, players first choose from one of six categories. The categories are animal, country, food, sports, science, and others. Olive Oyl will then select a word of random length from the selected category for Popeye to solve. Popeye solves the hidden word by punching letters, with the correct letters helping fill in the hidden word while incorrect guesses let Bluto knock into a suspended basket which holds Swee'Pea. If too many incorrect guesses are made Swee'Pea falls down and Popeye loses a round to Bluto. If Popeye fills in the word correctly before that happens, Popeye wins the round. Whoever (Popeye or Bluto) wins the most rounds out of ten wins Olive Oyl's love. There is also a question mark symbol, that when hit solves the puzzle automatically but also has the consequence of the player automatically losing that round.

Word Puzzle B is basically played the same way as Word Puzzle A is, with the exception that in B, the Japanese translation of that word isn't displayed in Katakana like it is in A. So mode B is meant for those who have honed their English to a higher degree. 

Word Catcher is a game mode for two players. Popeye and Bluto are tasked with catching English alphabet letters which are being tossed down from Olive Oyl. They must catch the letters in the correct order, so that they will spell out a translation of one of three Japanese words that are displayed. Each correct word spelled wins the player a round. Whoever wins five rounds first wins Olive Oyl.
