This game, which was never released outside of Japan, is all about the fast food clown Ronald McDonald (Donald McDonald in Japan) on his quest to rescue his friends from all sorts of danger. With only a bunch of bombs, the player must go through every stage, facing off against a myriad of odd creatures. 

The player can also collect hamburgers throughout each stage. These hamburgers can be used as currency at a shop at the end of each stage. Hamburgers can be spent on extra lives and hearts that refill the players energy bar. The store also sells a matching game where the player can win hearts and extra lives also.
