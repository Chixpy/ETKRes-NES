Final Fantasy I•II is a compilation of the first two Final Fantasy games, released in Japan only for the Nintendo Famicom.

Both games are almost identical to their original counterpart, although some of the changes from the English release of Final Fantasy were kept. This limited edition box also contains a handbook and maps for both games.
