Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou is a board game which is at the same time a life simulation. Four characters participate in the game, one of which is controlled by you, and the others either by the computer AI, or by other players. In the beginning, all your characters are at a "starting position", on a map that is composed of circles, some of which are empty, while others represent a building or a certain event. A roll of dice determines how many moves the character will make. Depending on the circle the character steps on, different things will occur. Random circles will take you to a journey or depict a simple day spent with your family. Others will add money to the character, or make him train and raise his physical condition, etc. The characters move over the entire board, living their lives, visiting school, meeting with each other, etc.
