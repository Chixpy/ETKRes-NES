This is a RPG set in the universe of the animé series Hokuto no Ken, known outside of Japan as Fist of the North Star. You, the nameless young hero, return to your home village after a prolonged absence, only to find out that a mysterious evil has been plaguing it, and everybody need his help. He decides to investigate the matter and starts a dangerous journey, during which he teams up with some of the characters from the animé series.

The gameplay is pretty similar to  Dragon Quest: you interact with things and people by choosing commands from a menu, wander around the world map and fight random enemies from first-person perspective. The enemies and your team members are shown as animé-style pictures during battles.
