Kidou Senshi Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble is the first known Mobile Suit Gundam game released on the NES. Mobile Suit Gundam is a popular anime T.V. series, which has been running since its first show (Mobile Suit Gundam) created in 1979, up until now, with the latest addition to the series being Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny. It introduced the mecha drama, contrary to super robot series.

The game includes both first-person shooting and side-scrolling elements of gameplay, the platform portions obviously inspired by the past year's hit, Thexder. It allows you to play as the Zeta Gundam, who can also transform into the wave-rider. The enemies consist of many different mobile suits from the show, including the Hizack, Messala, O, Gaplant and Psycho Gundam. Kidou Senshi Z-Gundam: Hot Scramble has been followed up by a continuing series of games covering many video game platforms.
